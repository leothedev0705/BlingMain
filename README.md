## Features

- Interactive chat interface
- Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model
- Quick responses to common navigation questions
- Conversation history and context awareness
- Error handling and recovery

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Gemini API key (get one from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment:

```bash
npm run setup
```

Follow the prompts to enter your Gemini API key. This will create a `.env` file with your API key.

### Testing the API Connection

To verify your API key is working correctly, run:

```bash
npm run test:gemini
```

This will send a test message to the Gemini API and display the response.

```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the website with the chatbot.

npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```

## Usage

The chatbot appears as a chat bubble in the bottom right corner of the website. Users can:

- Click the bubble to open the chat window
- Type questions or navigational queries in the input field
- Click the clear button to reset the conversation
- Close the chat by clicking the X button or clicking outside the chat window

## Customization

### Chatbot Appearance

The chatbot appearance can be customized in `src/components/ui/ChatBot.tsx`.

### AI Responses

- Modify the system prompt in the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant
- Adjust the model parameters in the `model` configuration

## Troubleshooting

1. Verify your API key is correct in the `.env` file
2. Make sure you've installed all dependencies with `npm install`
3. Check the browser console for any error messages
4. Run `npm run test:gemini` to test the API connection
